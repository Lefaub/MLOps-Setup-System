<h1>End to end Explanatory ML System Architecture</h1>
This repository is part of the public deliverable D 6.7 in the research project EXPLAIN. It contains the code of the final explanatory MLOps system. The system is a prototype, demonstrating model-based automation in MLOps setups.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Setting up the MLOps system requires several steps as prerequisites. 

<ol>
  <li>First, a Kubernetes cluster with at least one node needs to be setup (<a href="https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/gitlab/sse/explain-initial-architecture-implementation/-/tree/main/Infrastructure?ref_type=heads">Kubernetes Readme</a>).</li>
  <li>Install docker</li>
  <li>Docker login</li>
  <li>Create access token (read, write delete)</li>
  <li>Install <a href ="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/">helm</a></li>
  <li>Install python and python-pip</li>
  <li>pip install flask kubernetes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Running the UI for the MLOps platform setup</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository on the master node and clone the Tools below in the respective folders</li>
  <li>Run "sudo python main.py"</li>
  <li>Configure the data type, version tag, dockerhub name and all required features on the homepage.</li>
  <li>Click on "Generate" and on "Go to running platform services" button.</li>
  <li>Wait until containers are set up. Click on "ML pipeline code generation" and "Run ML pipeline".</li>
  <li>A new tab opens which allows to run scripts that enable the user to set up a ML pipelines, connecting the containers, selecting models, start training, inference services, or XAI methods.</li>
</ol>
